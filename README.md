# DeepLearning_Thesis

I investigated the performance of deep neural nets modeling neural encoding. The Jupyter notebook runs the appropriate models from the .py files; models created using TensorFlow and Keras. 

Note: not the final version (I can send that upon request), but gives a flavor for the approach.
